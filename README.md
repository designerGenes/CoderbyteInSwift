# CoderbyteInSwift
Coderbyte challenges written in Swift.

Please note that as of 12/21/17, Coderbyte uses Swift 3.  Upgrade to Swift 4 and beyond seems inevitable (and overdue).  The code here is written in Swift 4 so that it runs in current versions of Xcode, which means that (as of this writing) this code will need to be edited in order for Coderbyte to compile it without errors.  Usually this is very minor like changing string[4] to string.characters[].
